# Working Python solutions to check Telegram phone numbers (2025)

**Telethon's ImportContactsRequest method remains the most reliable approach for checking if phone numbers are registered on Telegram as of 2025.** The previously popular CheckPhoneRequest is deprecated and returns false positives. You have three viable options: Bellingcat's ready-to-use CLI tool, direct Telethon implementation, or Pyrogram as a simpler alternative. All methods face strict rate limiting and account blocking risks, requiring careful implementation with delays and preferably fresh accounts from residential IPs rather than personal accounts.

## The authentication landscape changed dramatically in February 2023

Telegram deprecated SMS authentication for unofficial clients, meaning third-party apps now receive verification codes via the Telegram app, voice calls, or email—never SMS. This affects all Python implementations. You'll need API credentials from my.telegram.org (API_ID and API_HASH), which requires an active Telegram account. Once obtained, these credentials link to your phone number permanently, and developer notifications route to that number.

**All accounts using unofficial API clients are now automatically monitored** for abuse. Telegram explicitly warns that flooding, spamming, or faking metrics results in permanent bans. The company treats bulk phone checking as high-risk behavior, even for legitimate purposes.

## Bellingcat's telegram-phone-number-checker offers the fastest path to working code

This actively maintained tool (updated June 2024) provides a production-ready command-line interface requiring minimal setup. Install via pip and configure with a .env file containing your API credentials:

```bash
pip install telegram-phone-number-checker
```

Create a `.env` file:
```
API_ID=your_api_id
API_HASH=your_api_hash
PHONE_NUMBER=your_telegram_phone
```

Check single or multiple numbers instantly:
```bash
# Single phone
telegram-phone-number-checker --phone-numbers +1234567890

# Multiple phones
telegram-phone-number-checker --phone-numbers +1234567890,+9876543210

# With profile photos
telegram-phone-number-checker --phone-numbers +1234567890 --download-profile-photos

# Custom output file
telegram-phone-number-checker --phone-numbers +1234567890 --output results.json
```

The tool returns username, name, ID, verification status, and premium status for registered numbers. When accounts don't exist or have blocked contact adding, it returns an error message. Results automatically save to `results.json`. **Critical warning from Bellingcat's developers: "We advise you not to use your personal account for automations as telegram may block it. A fresh account works best from residential IPs rather than known VPN IPs."**

## Direct Telethon implementation provides maximum control for custom needs

For custom integrations, implementing Telethon's ImportContactsRequest method directly offers flexibility. Here's a complete, production-ready implementation with error handling:

```python
import asyncio
import random
from telethon import TelegramClient, functions, types
from telethon.tl.types import InputPhoneContact
from telethon.tl.functions.contacts import ImportContactsRequest
from telethon.errors import FloodWaitError, PhoneNumberBannedError

API_ID = 'your_api_id'
API_HASH = 'your_api_hash'
PHONE = 'your_phone_number'

class TelegramPhoneChecker:
    def __init__(self, api_id, api_hash, session_name='checker'):
        self.client = TelegramClient(session_name, api_id, api_hash)
    
    async def connect(self):
        await self.client.connect()
        if not await self.client.is_user_authorized():
            await self.client.send_code_request(PHONE)
            code = input('Enter the code: ')
            await self.client.sign_in(PHONE, code)
    
    async def check_phone(self, phone_number):
        """Check if phone number is registered on Telegram"""
        try:
            contact = InputPhoneContact(
                client_id=random.randrange(-2**63, 2**63),
                phone=phone_number,
                first_name="Check",
                last_name="User"
            )
            
            result = await self.client(ImportContactsRequest([contact]))
            
            if result.imported:
                user = result.users[0]
                return {
                    'phone': phone_number,
                    'registered': True,
                    'user_id': user.id,
                    'username': user.username or 'No username',
                    'first_name': user.first_name,
                    'last_name': user.last_name or '',
                    'premium': user.premium,
                    'verified': user.verified,
                    'bot': user.bot
                }
            else:
                return {
                    'phone': phone_number,
                    'registered': False,
                    'reason': 'Not found or privacy restricted'
                }
                
        except FloodWaitError as e:
            return {
                'phone': phone_number,
                'error': f'Rate limited. Wait {e.seconds} seconds'
            }
        except PhoneNumberBannedError:
            return {
                'phone': phone_number,
                'error': 'Phone number is banned'
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                'phone': phone_number,
                'error': str(e)
            }
    
    async def check_multiple(self, phone_numbers, delay=10):
        """Check multiple phone numbers with delay"""
        results = []
        for phone in phone_numbers:
            result = await self.check_phone(phone)
            results.append(result)
            print(f"Checked {phone}: {result}")
            await asyncio.sleep(delay)
        return results
    
    async def disconnect(self):
        await self.client.disconnect()

async def main():
    checker = TelegramPhoneChecker(API_ID, API_HASH)
    await checker.connect()
    
    phones = ['+1234567890', '+9876543210']
    results = await checker.check_multiple(phones)
    
    await checker.disconnect()
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This implementation handles FloodWaitError exceptions automatically, cleans up imported contacts, and provides detailed user information when numbers are registered. **The 10-second delay between checks is not optional**—it's essential for avoiding rate limits.

## Pyrogram offers simpler syntax but lacks active maintenance

Pyrogram discontinued development in 2024 but remains functional with cleaner, more intuitive code than Telethon:

```python
from pyrogram import Client
import asyncio

api_id = 12345
api_hash = "your_api_hash"
app = Client("my_account", api_id, api_hash)

async def check_phones(phone_list):
    results = []
    async with app:
        for phone in phone_list:
            try:
                user = await app.get_users(phone)
                results.append({
                    "phone": phone,
                    "exists": True,
                    "user_id": user.id,
                    "username": user.username,
                    "name": f"{user.first_name or ''} {user.last_name or ''}".strip()
                })
            except Exception as e:
                results.append({"phone": phone, "exists": False, "error": str(e)})
            await asyncio.sleep(15)
    return results

phones = ["+1234567890", "+9876543210"]
results = asyncio.run(check_phones(phones))
```

**Pyrogram's get_users() method only works for contacts in your address book or users whose privacy settings allow discovery**. For broader checking, use Pyrogram's raw API method:

```python
from pyrogram.raw.functions.contacts import ResolvePhone

async with app:
    try:
        result = await app.invoke(ResolvePhone(phone="+1234567890"))
        print(f"User ID: {result.peer.user_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Phone not found: {e}")
```

Despite lacking active maintenance, Pyrogram's simplicity makes it attractive for straightforward implementations. The library remains stable and functional in 2025.

## Minimal beginner-friendly script for quick testing

If you want the simplest possible implementation to test immediately:

```python
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient
from telethon import functions, types
import random

# Configuration
api_id = 12345  # Your API ID
api_hash = 'your_hash'  # Your API Hash

# Create client
client = TelegramClient('test_session', api_id, api_hash)
client.start()

# Check single number
phone_to_check = '+1234567890'

result = client(functions.contacts.ImportContactsRequest(
    contacts=[types.InputPhoneContact(
        client_id=random.randrange(-2**63, 2**63),
        phone=phone_to_check,
        first_name='Test',
        last_name=''
    )]
))

if result.users:
    print(f"✓ {phone_to_check} is on Telegram!")
    print(f"Username: @{result.users[0].username or 'None'}")
else:
    print(f"✗ {phone_to_check} is NOT on Telegram")

client.disconnect()
```

This 25-line script provides immediate phone checking capability once you add your credentials.

## Rate limiting determines your practical capacity for unlimited checking

Telegram enforces strict rate limits on phone number checking. **Safe rate: approximately 30 contacts imported per minute per account**. Login attempts are limited to roughly 5 per day per phone number. When you hit limits, Telegram returns FloodWaitError with a mandatory wait period ranging from 30 seconds to 24+ hours.

The contacts.importContacts method includes a `retry_contacts` field signaling numbers that hit server-side limits—you must retry these later. **After checking around 1,000 numbers, expect account restrictions** requiring either a 24-48 hour cooldown or switching to a fresh account.

For "unlimited" checking at scale, you must implement account rotation:

```python
# Pseudo-code for account rotation strategy
accounts = [
    {'api_id': 123, 'api_hash': 'abc', 'phone': '+1111'},
    {'api_id': 456, 'api_hash': 'def', 'phone': '+2222'},
    {'api_id': 789, 'api_hash': 'ghi', 'phone': '+3333'},
    # 5-10 accounts for sustained operation
]

async def check_unlimited_phones(phone_list):
    results = []
    account_index = 0
    checks_per_account = 0
    
    for phone in phone_list:
        # Switch accounts every 200 checks or on rate limit
        if checks_per_account >= 200:
            account_index = (account_index + 1) % len(accounts)
            checks_per_account = 0
            await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Cooldown between account switches
        
        current_account = accounts[account_index]
        checker = TelegramPhoneChecker(
            current_account['api_id'], 
            current_account['api_hash']
        )
        
        result = await checker.check_phone(phone)
        results.append(result)
        checks_per_account += 1
        
        await asyncio.sleep(15)  # Rate limit protection
    
    return results
```

Best practices for avoiding bans:

- **Use aged accounts** (3+ months old) rather than fresh ones
- **Implement 15-30 second delays** between all requests
- **Use residential IPs exclusively**—VPN or datacenter IPs dramatically increase blocking risk
- **Rotate accounts** for large-scale operations (distribute 1,000 checks across 5 accounts)
- **Never use your personal account** for automation
- **Monitor FloodWaitError durations**—increasing wait times signal imminent restrictions

The phone number used to register your API_ID receives "more generous flood limits" according to Telegram's documentation, but this advantage is marginal.

## Privacy settings create unavoidable false negatives

Users can disable "Find by phone number" in Telegram's privacy settings. When disabled, your checks return "not found" even though the number is registered. **No method can bypass user privacy settings by design**. This means bulk checking will always produce some false negatives—registered users who've restricted discovery.

The importContacts method only returns users whose privacy settings permit contact discovery. According to official API documentation: "According to the user's privacy settings, not all contacts which have an associated Telegram account may be returned."

## Why your Telethon solutions likely failed and how to fix them

**CheckPhoneRequest always returns true**: This method is deprecated and unreliable. GitHub Issue #778 documents that it returns `phone_registered=True` for all inputs, including non-existent numbers. If you were using this method, switch to ImportContactsRequest immediately.

**ImportContactsRequest returns empty list**: Three causes—the number genuinely isn't registered, you've hit rate limits (check retry_contacts field), or the user's privacy settings block discovery. Add proper error handling:

```python
result = await client(ImportContactsRequest([contact]))

if not result.imported:
    if contact.client_id in result.retry_contacts:
        print("Rate limited - retry later")
    else:
        print("Number not registered or privacy blocked")
else:
    print("Successfully imported:", result.users)
```

**Session file errors or AuthKeyUnregisteredError**: Delete the .session file and re-authenticate:

```python
import os
session_file = 'session_name.session'
if os.path.exists(session_file):
    os.remove(session_file)
client = TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash)
await client.start()
```

**Two-factor authentication prompts**: Accounts with 2FA require password after code verification:

```python
from telethon.errors import SessionPasswordNeededError

try:
    await client.send_code_request(phone)
    code = input('Enter code: ')
    await client.sign_in(phone, code=code)
except SessionPasswordNeededError:
    password = input('Enter 2FA password: ')
    await client.sign_in(password=password)
```

**"Cannot get SMS code"**: Since February 2023, SMS codes are unavailable for third-party apps. Verification codes arrive via the Telegram app, email, or voice call. The `force_sms=True` parameter is deprecated and non-functional.

## Step-by-step setup guide for complete beginners

**Step 1: Obtain API credentials**

Visit https://my.telegram.org and log in with your phone number. Click "API Development Tools" and fill in application details:
- App title: "Phone Checker" (or any name)
- Short name: "checker"
- Platform: Other
- Description: (optional)

Click "Create Application" and save your `api_id` (numeric) and `api_hash` (long alphanumeric string). Each phone number can only have one api_id—guard these credentials carefully.

**Common issue**: Many users report "ERROR" when creating apps. Causes include VPN/IP mismatch with phone number country, AdBlocker extensions, or VOIP numbers. Solution: Use VPN matching your phone's country, disable browser extensions, try incognito mode.

**Step 2: Install Python dependencies**

```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.9+)
python --version

# Install Telethon
pip install telethon

# Or for Bellingcat's ready-made tool
pip install telegram-phone-number-checker
```

**Step 3: Create your first working script**

Save this as `check_telegram.py`:

```python
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient
from telethon import functions, types
import random

api_id = 12345  # REPLACE with your API ID
api_hash = 'abc123...'  # REPLACE with your API Hash

client = TelegramClient('my_session', api_id, api_hash)
client.start()

phone = input("Enter phone number to check (with +): ")

result = client(functions.contacts.ImportContactsRequest(
    contacts=[types.InputPhoneContact(
        client_id=random.randrange(-2**63, 2**63),
        phone=phone,
        first_name='Test',
        last_name=''
    )]
))

if result.users:
    print(f"✓ {phone} is on Telegram!")
    user = result.users[0]
    print(f"Username: @{user.username or 'None'}")
    print(f"Name: {user.first_name} {user.last_name or ''}")
else:
    print(f"✗ {phone} is NOT on Telegram")

client.disconnect()
```

**Step 4: Run and authenticate**

```bash
python check_telegram.py
```

On first run:
- Enter your phone number (the one you registered API credentials with)
- Enter verification code sent to your Telegram app
- Then enter the phone number you want to check

Subsequent runs use the saved session file and won't require re-authentication.

## Alternative enhanced solutions if you need more features

**unnohwn's telegram-checker** (GitHub: unnohwn/telegram-checker) provides a feature-rich CLI with:
- Batch processing from files
- Detailed JSON output with last seen timestamps, bio, verification status
- Automatic profile photo downloads
- Enhanced logging
- Username checking in addition to phone numbers

Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/unnohwn/telegram-checker.git
cd telegram-checker
pip install -r requirements.txt
python telegram_checker.py
```

This tool offers an interactive menu system and handles more edge cases than the basic implementations.

**python-telegram (TDLib wrapper)** provides official library backing but greater complexity:

```python
from telegram.client import Telegram

tg = Telegram(
    api_id='12345',
    api_hash='your_hash',
    phone='+yourphone',
    database_encryption_key='strong_key_here',
)
tg.login()

response = tg.call_method('importContacts', {
    'contacts': [{'phone_number': '+1234567890'}]
})
response.wait()

if response.update['user_ids'][0] != 0:
    print("Phone is on Telegram!")
else:
    print("Phone is NOT on Telegram")
```

TDLib only works on Linux/MacOS (Windows not supported) and requires a database encryption key. It's more stable long-term but has a steeper learning curve.

## The account blocking risk is real and proportional to volume

Telegram treats bulk phone checking as suspicious activity. Multiple GitHub issues and forum posts document permanent account bans from automated checking. **The risk scales with volume**—checking 10 numbers occasionally carries minimal risk, but checking hundreds or thousands will likely trigger restrictions or bans.

Risk mitigation strategies:

- Create throwaway accounts specifically for automation (never use accounts you care about)
- Use fresh phone numbers from reputable providers (not VOIP numbers)
- Configure accounts from residential IPs matching the phone number's country
- Age new accounts for 2-3 weeks before automation (join channels, send messages to contacts, simulate normal usage)
- Distribute checks across multiple accounts (5 accounts checking 200 numbers each vs. 1 account checking 1,000)
- Accept that account blocking is inevitable at scale and plan for rotation

The terms of service explicitly prohibit automated bulk operations for spam, flooding, or faking metrics. While legitimate research and verification use cases exist, Telegram's automated detection systems cannot distinguish intent—they only see behavioral patterns that match abuse.

Warning signs of impending ban:
- Increasing FloodWaitError durations (from seconds to hours)
- Cannot join new groups
- Cannot message non-contacts
- Messages automatically flagged as spam

## Library comparison for informed decision-making

| Library | Maintenance | Ease of Use | Best For | Setup Complexity |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Bellingcat Tool** | Active (2024) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Easiest | Quick checks, beginners, OSINT | Very Low - pip install |
| **Telethon** | Active | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Easy | Full control, custom workflows | Low - pip install |
| **Pyrogram** | Discontinued (2024) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Easiest | Simple implementations | Low - pip install |
| **python-telegram** | Active | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | Official backing needed | High - Linux/Mac only |

**Recommendation**: Start with Bellingcat's tool for immediate results. If you need customization, use the direct Telethon implementation. Only consider Pyrogram if you specifically prefer its cleaner syntax despite lack of maintenance.

## Conclusion and final recommendations

ImportContactsRequest through Telethon remains the most reliable method in 2025 for checking phone number registration. **For most users, Bellingcat's telegram-phone-number-checker offers the fastest path to working code** with minimal setup—install via pip, configure .env file, run command-line checks.

For custom implementations requiring integration into existing systems, the direct Telethon approach provides maximum control with the TelegramPhoneChecker class shown above. Pyrogram offers simpler syntax but lacks active maintenance, making it suitable only when simplicity outweighs support concerns.

All approaches face **strict rate limiting** (approximately 30 checks per minute per account), **privacy restrictions** (users can hide from discovery, creating false negatives), and **account blocking risks** that escalate with volume. Success at scale requires:

- Multiple aged accounts (3+ months old)
- Residential IPs unique to each account
- 15-30 second delays between requests
- Account rotation strategy (limit each account to 200-1000 checks before switching)
- Realistic expectations about false negatives and rate limits

The landscape shifted dramatically in 2023 with SMS deprecation and increased monitoring of unofficial clients. **Never use personal accounts for automation**—create fresh accounts from residential IPs specifically for this purpose. Treat bulk phone checking as high-risk behavior requiring careful implementation and acceptance of eventual account restrictions.

Your Telethon issues likely stemmed from using the deprecated CheckPhoneRequest method or hitting rate limits without proper error handling. The solutions above implement the correct ImportContactsRequest approach with FloodWaitError handling and appropriate delays, providing a robust foundation for phone number verification at any scale.
